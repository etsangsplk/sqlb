# `sqlb` Documentation

`sqlb` is a Golang library that allows users to construct complex SQL queries
without manually constructing strings.

The [Getting Started](getting-started.md) guide is the first place you'll want
to begin exploring how you can use `sqlb` in your project.

Once familiar with the basics, you may want to then check out some of the
[tutorials](tutorials/) that explain some of the more complex concepts in `sqlb`.

A collection of [How Tos](how-to/) gives the user code examples and recipes
for using `sqlb` to solve specific problems or model specific SQL constructs.

Finally, a [Reference Guide](reference.md) details the library's public structs
and functions.
